## MVP User Stories

## Reflections

Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
TH: We have achieved our MVP and most features are working as intended, however there are a few flaws.

üéØ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
TH: Due to the large scope and complexity of our MVP, even after we cut it down a couple of times, we were working on it right up to the coding deadline and had no chances to work on any of the stretch goal or fix the bugs present in the MVP.

üéØ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
TH: Because of new techniques used in the database and how disorginised the code was when creating types and domains it was difficult to explain how the database works to my teammates.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
